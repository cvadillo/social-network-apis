## Description

Began messing with mongodb with the bootcamp class and like the Sequel module, the task was to create a social media style set of APIs that allow a user to create a username, email, add friends, add comments, and add reactions. The project was created with MongoDB and Mongoose. Models for the user and Thoughts (comments) were created and the database was seeded locally using Postman on localhost: 3001.
